# Object-Oriented Programming
There are four major principles that underpin object-oriented programming; these are abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. Below you can find the definitions of each principle, which highlight the purpose and benefit of implementing them when writing code.


### Abstraction
Hiding complexity, such as the internal state and functionality of an object, by implementing public methods to limit direct access.

### Encapsulation

### Inheritance
...

### Polymorphism
